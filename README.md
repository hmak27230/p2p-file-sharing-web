# 🌐 P2P File Sharing Web App

A **pure‑front‑end** simulation of a decentralized P2P file‑sharing network, complete with:
- **Peer connection** (mocked): connect/disconnect to a simulated index server  
- **File upload & registration** with progress bars  
- **Search & download** of shared files, auto‑seeding on download  
- **Live stats**: files shared, total downloads, and peers connected  
- **Activity log** tracing every network event
